# Anthony0.8 Project

**Anthony0.8** is a Python-based English virtual assistant designed for use via the Windows Command Prompt (cmd). It supports both voice and keyboard input, responding in spoken and text forms. Using the OpenAI API, it understands natural language, executes various tasks, and offers customizable responses. Built-in commands and detailed documentation make Anthony0.8 a user-friendly and efficient tool for Windows users. 

After you run the [main.py](main.py) file, the assistant wakes up when you say 'Hello Anthony' and terminates when you say 'Goodbye Anthony'.

## Project Overview

This project consists of the following components:

### [main.py](main.py)
- **`manual_loop`**: Processes manual commands via keyboard input. Users can switch to voice input by typing `"vocal override"`. If `unmute` is `False`, press ENTER after each bot reply to continue.
- **`vocal_loop`**: Processes voice commands via microphone input. Users can switch to manual input by saying `"manual override"`. If `unmute` is `False`, press ENTER after each bot reply. After five failed recognition attempts, the bot automatically grants manual override.

### [commands.py](commands.py)
- **`_listened`**: Checks if specific word combinations exist in the input text and returns `True` or `False`.
- **`echo`**: Repeats the input text.
- **`chat_with_gpt`**: Uses the OpenAI API to respond to user prompts (requires an API key).
- **`respond_to`**: Main function for processing user input and generating bot responses.

### [bot/](bot)
#### [writing.py](bot/writing.py)
- **`clear_cmd`**: Clears the Command Prompt.
- **`type`**: Outputs text with typing effects, including pauses and formatting.
- **`paste`**: Outputs text without typing effects, maintaining formatting.

#### [reading.py](bot/reading.py)
- **`clear_cmd`**: Clears the Command Prompt.
- **`takeInput`**: Captures user input with support for corrections, reprints text when "going back to the previous line" is necessary.

#### [speaking.py](bot/speaking.py)
- **`speak`**: Converts text to speech using the `pyttsx3` library (requires pre-initialized engine).

#### [hearing.py](bot/hearing.py)
- **`clear_cmd`**: Clears the Command Prompt.
- **`wakeup`**: Waits until the wakeup phrase is detected.
- **`takeCommand`**: Captures spoken input using `speech_recognition`. Returns `None` if no input is detected within 10 seconds or if an error occurs.

### [results/](results)
Stores the history of the last conversation.
